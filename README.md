### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
This is a self-introduction page for a sophomore student from China.  


#### About ME
I am dedicated to contributing valuable code to the community. Currently, I specialize in backend development.     
My blog site is [ç»¯å¢ƒä¹‹å¤–](http://blog.scarletborders.top/), where I occasionally update my personal status, primarily in Chinese, apologies for that.   

#### Skills
The advanced languages I used most currently are Python, C# and Golang.

I'm currently exploring indie game developing ways.

Details of other technologies I'm familiar with are listed in the table below. Additionally, I am well-versed in mainstream programming architectures.
