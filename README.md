### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a sophomore student from China.

 #### About Me
 I'm passionate about building valuable applications with code and am currently focusing on my journey in backend development. I hope to make my own small contributions to the open-source community.

 I occasionally share my learning notes and personal thoughts on my blog, **[ç»¯å¢ƒä¹‹å¤–](https://blog.scarletborder.cn)** (mostly in Chinese).

 #### Interests & Exploration
 The languages I'm currently working with most are Golang, TypeScript and Python.

 In my spare time, I'm also exploring the world of indie game development, hoping to create interesting worlds in a different field.
