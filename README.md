### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
This is a self-introduction page for a sophomore student from China.  


#### About ME
I am dedicated to contributing valuable code to the community. Currently, I specialize in backend development. 
My blog site is [ç»¯å¢ƒä¹‹å¤–](http://blog.scarletborders.top/), where I occasionally update my personal status, primarily in Chinese, apologies for that. 

#### Skills
The advanced languages I currently use most are Python and Golang, while I also know C++ and Javascript but don't use them as frequently. 
Details of other technologies I'm familiar with are listed in the table below. Additionally, I am well-versed in mainstream programming architectures.
